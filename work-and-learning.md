I don't focus on building polished products for show. Most of my work is exploratory, accessibility-focused, or rooted
in lived experience. This page highlights the kinds of projects I spend time on rather than a list of finished
deliverables.

## Accessibility & Usability Testing

I regularly test websites, apps, and software for accessibility, with a focus on:

- Screen reader usability (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Keyboard navigation
- Cognitive and sensory accessibility
- Real-world usability for multiply disabled users

Some of this work is paid usability testing; some is informal feedback, bug reports, or advocacy.

## Learning & Technical Exploration

As a self-paced computer science and full-stack student, I work on:

- Small coding exercises and experiments
- Learning projects from Codecademy and other curricula
- Exploring how accessibility fits into real-world development workflows

Most of this work lives on GitHub rather than as standalone apps.

## Self-Hosted & Personal Tools

I experiment with self-hosting tools and services, including:

- Personal websites (GitHub Pages + Cloudflare)
- LanguageTool servers
- Bookmark managers and monitoring tools
- Accessibility-related configurations and workflows

These projects help me understand both technical systems and the user experience of maintaining them.

## Advocacy & Community Work

Some of my most meaningful “projects” aren't code:

- Disability advocacy and peer support
- Moderating and co-leading online disability communities
- Writing and speaking about accessibility, faith, and technology

This work informs everything else I do.
