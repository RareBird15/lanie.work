Hi, I'm Lanie.

I'm a Christian, a blind, autistic, chronically ill programmer and usability tester, and an advocate for accessibility
and disability rights.

My work and advocacy are shaped by lived experience with multiple disabilities and a desire to make technology more
inclusive, practical, and humane. I approach accessibility not just as a technical challenge, but as a reflection of
care, dignity, and faith.

I'm currently studying IT support, computer science, and full-stack engineering through Codecademy; theology through
Christian Leaders Institute; nonprofit development through NonprofitReady; bookkeeping through Lumen Learning; and
Braille proofreading through the National Federation of the Blind. I've developed my own self-paced learning path
because traditional education options often aren't accessible or accommodating enough for my needs.

In addition to my studies, I serve as **IT Manager** for my mom's small business, Apache Restoration & Design. In this
role, I handle day-to-day technology decisions, software evaluation, accessibility considerations, and systems setup.
This work gives me hands-on experience supporting real users with real constraints, and it strongly informs how I think
about usability, sustainability, and accessibility in practice.

My long-term goal is to help build or support a nonprofit by and for people with multiple disabilities, focused on
access to resources, education, assistive technology, and community. I'm especially interested in work that recognizes
the complexity of living with overlapping disabilities rather than treating them in isolation.

Outside of formal work and study, I spend time evaluating games and digital tools for accessibility, experimenting with
assistive technology, and learning how systems break. I'm especially interested in how they can be designed to work
better for real users. I value slower, thoughtful problem-solving, clear communication, and tools that respect users'
energy, cognition, and autonomy.

This site serves as a home base for my work, selected writing, and accessibility notes. It's intentionally small,
updated selectively, and focused on clarity over volume.
