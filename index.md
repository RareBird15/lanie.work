Working at the intersection of faith, technology, and disability advocacy.

My work focuses on **accessibility** as both a technical responsibility and a reflection of God’s love for His children,
grounded in **faith**, **technology**, and **disability advocacy**.

## What I Focus On

- **Accessibility & usability testing**: Evaluating software and digital tools with a focus on real-world accessibility
  for disabled users.

- **Programming & learning**: Developing skills and projects with accessibility in mind from the start.

- **Disability advocacy**: Sharing lived experience to help make technology more inclusive for people with multiple
  disabilities.

- **Faith-informed perspective**: Approaching life, work, and advocacy through a Christ-centered lens.

- **Documenting accessibility barriers**: Writing about recurring accessibility challenges I encounter in games and
  interactive media, grounded in lived experience as a blind, autistic, chronically ill user.
