This page documents **recurring accessibility barriers** I encounter in games and interactive media.

It exists for two reasons:

- To help other disabled gamers avoid wasting time and money on things that won't work for them
- To give developers concrete, real-world examples of where accessibility breaks down

This is **not a comprehensive review list**, and it is **not a judgment of a game's quality**. A game can be excellent
and still be inaccessible to me.

## Who These Notes Are For

These notes may be useful if you:

- Use a screen reader or refreshable Braille display
- Are blind and rely on keyboard navigation
- Have sensory sensitivities, neurological conditions, or fatigue
- Prefer untimed, low-pressure gameplay
- Enjoy strategy, incremental, or text-driven games over fast-paced or spatial ones
- Are a developer looking for concrete examples of accessibility barriers

## Common Barriers I Run Into

The issues below are patterns I see repeatedly across many games.

### Unlabeled or Nonstandard Controls

- Form fields, buttons, or options are not announced by screen readers
- Selection state (what is currently chosen) is not exposed
- Controls rely on visual cues only

### Mouse-Only or Canvas-Based Interfaces

- Games that require mouse interaction without keyboard alternatives
- Heavy use of canvas, WebGL, or Unity without accessibility hooks
- Interfaces that screen readers cannot interpret at all

### Maps and Spatial Navigation

- Games that require building or interpreting mental maps
- Directional audio combined with navigation requirements
- Punishment for taking the “wrong path” without clear feedback

### Time Pressure and Speed Requirements

- Real-time mechanics without pause or turn-based alternatives
- Systems that penalize slower reaction times
- Gameplay that requires rushing or rapid decision-making

### Audio Overload

- Too many simultaneous sounds
- Reliance on audio positioning
- No way to reduce, simplify, or disable audio

## Examples of Games That Don't Work for Me

> These examples are illustrative, not exhaustive.

### NationStates

- Core setup flow uses unlabeled controls
- Selection state is not announced
- Screen reader users cannot reliably tell what is selected or activated

### Many Unity-Based PC Games

- Do not expose UI elements to screen readers
- Often require mouse interaction
- Accessibility improvements seen on mobile do not carry over to PC

### Shooter and Audio-Navigation Games

- Heavy reliance on directional sound and spatial awareness
- Often overwhelming or unusable due to sensory and neurological factors

## A Note on Personal Fit

Accessibility is not one-size-fits-all.

Some games listed here are enjoyed by other blind gamers, especially those who:

- Rely primarily on audio
- Enjoy spatial navigation
- Prefer fast-paced or reflex-based gameplay

My needs are different, and these notes reflect **my specific access needs**.

---

## What _Does_ Tend to Work Better for Me

- Menu-driven or turn-based gameplay
- Incremental or strategy games with clear text output
- Keyboard-only interaction
- Untimed or low-pressure systems
- Interfaces that behave like standard web forms or documents

## Updates

This page is updated **occasionally**, when a clear pattern emerges. I do not document every game I try.
