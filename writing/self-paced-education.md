## Introduction: Why Self-Paced Education Matters

As someone with multiple disabilities, including total blindness, autism, and chronic health conditions, I have found
that traditional educational settings often fail to accommodate my unique learning needs. I have tried to attend college
online four times, and community college once in person, but each attempt was met with significant challenges that
hindered my ability to succeed. Barriers included rigid schedules, campuses that required physical navigation and mental
mapping, being taught only one way to learn, a lack of understanding from educators about how to support students with
diverse needs, and financial aid that was only available if I attended at least half-time. These obstacles made it clear
that a different approach to education was necessary for me to thrive. This realization led me to embrace self-paced
education, which has allowed me to learn in a way that suits my abilities and circumstances.

This is a long-form essay that explores self-paced education, systemic barriers in traditional and online learning,
financial constraints, and a vision for more inclusive educational models for multiply disabled learners.

## What “Self-Paced” Really Means

Many people think of self-paced education as simply learning at one’s own speed. While that is a key component, true
self-paced education encompasses much more. It involves having the freedom to choose when, where, attend, and how to
learn. It means being able to select the resources and methods that work best for an individual’s unique needs. For me,
this has meant utilizing a variety of tools and strategies, such as online courses that allow for flexible deadlines,
interactive projects, and assistive technologies that cater to my blindness and autism, including artificial
intelligence tools, often a gray area at traditional institutions, and screen readers. Self-paced education also allows
for breaks when needed, which is crucial for managing my chronic health conditions. Ultimately, self-paced education is
about creating a learning environment that is adaptable and responsive to the learner’s needs, rather than forcing the
learner to conform to a rigid system.

Another key aspect is finding your own way to learn, rather than being confined to a single method that may not suit
you. Throughout my attempts at traditional education, I was often expected to learn in a way that did not work for me,
such as by taking notes in a linear fashion or participating in online discussions that my chronic health conditions
made difficult to keep up with. Self-paced education has empowered me to explore different learning styles and discover
what works best for me, whether that be through hands-on projects, untimed quizzes, or text-based materials. Traditional
education systems often teach in a one-size-fits-all manner, which can be particularly challenging for students with
disabilities. Self-paced education allows for a more personalized approach, enabling learners to tailor their
educational experiences to their individual strengths and needs.

People with multiple disabilities also often need to pause, sometimes for days, weeks, or even longer, to recover from
health setbacks. Self-paced education accommodates this need, allowing learners to take the time they require without
the pressure of falling behind peers. This flexibility is essential for maintaining both physical and mental well-being
while pursuing educational goals.

## Learning While Multiply Disabled

Learning while multiply disabled is not simply the sum of several separate challenges. Disabilities interact with one
another in ways that compound difficulty and unpredictability. An accommodation that supports one disability may worsen
the impact of another, and systems that are designed with a single access need in mind often fail when multiple needs
are present at the same time. For example, tools that rely heavily on video may exclude blind learners, while
fast-paced, discussion-heavy environments can overwhelm autistic learners or those with limited cognitive energy. When
chronic illness is added to the mix, the ability to participate consistently becomes even more fragile.

One of the most significant barriers multiply disabled learners face is variability. Energy, cognition, pain levels, and
sensory tolerance can fluctuate daily or even hourly. Traditional education models tend to treat inconsistency as a lack
of effort or commitment, rather than as a natural consequence of disability. Deadlines, attendance requirements, and
rigid pacing leave little room for these fluctuations, forcing learners to choose between their health and their
education. Over time, this creates burnout, discouragement, and the false belief that learning itself is the problem.

Another challenge is that much of education assumes a narrow definition of engagement. Participation is often measured
by visible activity: logging in at specific times, speaking in discussions, watching videos in full, or progressing
through material at a predetermined rate. For multiply disabled learners, meaningful engagement may look very different.
It may involve reading transcripts instead of watching videos, revisiting material multiple times, learning in short
bursts, or stepping away entirely during health setbacks. These forms of engagement are no less valid, but they are
rarely recognized or supported in traditional settings.

Because of these factors, multiply disabled learners are often not lacking ability or motivation. What we lack is
educational infrastructure that is designed for lives marked by complexity, uncertainty, and limited reserves.
Self-paced education acknowledges this reality. It creates space for learners to engage when they are able, to pause
when they must, and to return without penalty or shame. For multiply disabled people, this is not a luxury or a
preference. It is often the difference between being able to learn at all and being forced to give up.

## Why Traditional Education Models Fall Short

Conventional education programs are often built around rigid structures that do not accommodate the diverse needs of all
learners, particularly those with multiple disabilities. These models typically require students to adhere to fixed
schedules, attend classes in person or at specific times, and complete assignments within strict deadlines. Such
inflexibility can create significant barriers for students who may need to take breaks for health reasons, require
alternative learning methods, or need additional time to process information. Additionally, traditional education often
emphasizes a one-size-fits-all approach to teaching and assessment, which can disadvantage students who do not fit the
standard mold. For example, students with disabilities may struggle with standardized tests or group projects that do
not account for their unique challenges. Furthermore, the lack of understanding and support from educators regarding the
needs of students with disabilities can lead to feelings of isolation and frustration. Overall, traditional education
models often fail to provide the necessary accommodations and flexibility required for students with multiple
disabilities to succeed.

Even online education, which is often touted as more accessible, can still fall short for multiply disabled learners.
Many online programs maintain rigid deadlines, require synchronous participation, or rely heavily on multimedia content
that may not be accessible to all students. Without the ability to tailor the learning experience to individual needs,
online education can perpetuate the same barriers found in traditional settings. When I attended college online, I was
given extensions on all assignments except for discussion posts, which were a significant part of the grade. When I
asked disability services about this, I was told that discussion posts were considered participation and therefore not
eligible for extensions. I had some instructors who were kind enough to give me extensions anyway, but this often left
me behind the next week and struggling to catch up. In the end, I had to withdraw from the courses because I simply
could not keep up with the pace while managing my health, and trying to do so was making me physically sicker.

Finally, in traditional education settings, you must prove your disability repeatedly to access accommodations. This
process can be exhausting and retraumatizing, especially for those with invisible or fluctuating disabilities. Each new
course or semester often requires fresh documentation and justification for accommodations, which can be a significant
administrative burden. This constant need to validate one’s disability can detract from the focus on learning and
exacerbate feelings of alienation. For multiply disabled learners, who may already face skepticism or misunderstanding
about their conditions, this process can be particularly discouraging. It creates an additional layer of barriers that
hinder access to education rather than facilitating it.

## Financial Barriers and the Cost of Inflexibility

Financial barriers also play a significant role in the challenges faced by multiply disabled learners in traditional
education settings. Many financial aid programs require students to attend at least half-time to qualify for assistance.
This requirement can be particularly burdensome for students with multiple disabilities, who may need to take reduced
course loads or take breaks from their studies to manage their health. The pressure to maintain a certain enrollment
status can lead to increased stress and exacerbate health issues, ultimately hindering academic success. Additionally,
the costs associated with accommodations, assistive technologies, and healthcare can add to the financial strain faced
by these students. Without adequate financial support and flexibility, many multiply disabled learners find it difficult
to pursue higher education, leading to missed opportunities for personal and professional growth.

Even disability-specific financial aid can come with restrictions that make it challenging for multiply disabled
learners to access education. For example, a scholarship designed for students with disabilities may require full-time
enrollment or consistent attendance, which may not be feasible for those managing multiple health conditions. These
limitations can create a catch-22 situation, where students are unable to access the financial support they need because
of the very challenges they face in pursuing their education. As a result, many capable and motivated learners are left
without the resources necessary to succeed academically. As someone who has faced these financial barriers firsthand, I
understand the importance of flexible financial aid options that accommodate the unique needs of multiply disabled
learners. Without such flexibility, the pursuit of education can become an insurmountable challenge. I myself often
pushed myself to attend more classes than I could handle just to maintain my financial aid, which ultimately led to
worsened health and academic setbacks.

There are vocational rehabilitation programs that are supposed to help people with disabilities get training and
education for in-demand jobs. However, these programs often have strict requirements and limited funding, making it
difficult for multiply disabled learners to access the support they need. Additionally, the application and approval
processes can be complex and time-consuming, further hindering access to education and training opportunities. As a
result, many multiply disabled individuals are left without the resources necessary to pursue their educational and
career goals. I have had to walk away from vocational rehabilitation services multiple times because they did not
consider all of my disabilities, put me down, or told me I could only get help if I attended a state college full-time,
which I could not do.

## What Has Helped Me Learn Anyway

Despite the numerous challenges I have faced in traditional educational settings, I have found ways to continue my
learning journey. Embracing self-paced education has been a crucial factor in my ability to learn effectively. By
choosing courses and programs that allow for flexibility in scheduling and pacing, I have been able to tailor my
learning experience to my unique needs. Utilizing assistive technologies, such as screen readers and AI tools, has also
played a significant role in enhancing my learning experience. These technologies have enabled me to access course
materials in formats that are more compatible with my disabilities.

I now learn using a combination of platforms like freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, the Christian Leaders Institute, and various
AI tools. These resources allow me to learn at my own pace, take breaks when needed, and revisit material as often as
necessary. Additionally, I have found that engaging in project-based learning and hands-on activities helps me retain
information better than traditional lecture-based methods. I believe connecting with communities of learners who share
similar challenges would also be beneficial, but I have not yet found such a community that fully understands the
complexities of multiple disabilities.

Another strategy that has helped me is giving myself permission _not_ to take notes, something I struggled with in
traditional settings. I used to feel pressured to take detailed notes during lectures or readings, which often led to
cognitive overload and fatigue. Now, I focus on understanding the material during my initial exposure and rely on
revisiting the content later if needed. This approach has reduced my stress and allowed me to engage more deeply with
the material. Notes pose several challenges for me as a blind autistic learner. Writing or typing notes can be
time-consuming and distracting, taking away from my focus on understanding the content. I spend more time trying to
summarize and organize my notes than actually learning. Additionally, reviewing notes later can be overwhelming,
especially if they are lengthy or disorganized. I often find myself getting lost in my own notes, making it difficult to
extract key information. By letting go of the expectation to take notes, I have been able to focus more on comprehension
and retention, ultimately enhancing my learning experience.

Finally, using AI tools has revolutionized my learning process. These tools assist me in generating summaries,
explaining complex concepts, and providing alternative explanations when I struggle to grasp a topic. AI has become an
invaluable resource, allowing me to overcome barriers that traditional educational methods could not address.

## The Value of Self-Paced Education

Self-paced education has been a game-changer for me as a learner with multiple disabilities. It has provided me with the
flexibility and autonomy I need to navigate my unique challenges effectively. By allowing me to learn at my own pace,
take breaks when necessary, and choose learning methods that work best for me, self-paced education has empowered me to
take control of my learning journey. This approach has not only improved my academic performance but has also boosted my
confidence and motivation to continue learning. Self-paced education recognizes and respects the diverse needs of
learners, particularly those with multiple disabilities, and provides a more inclusive and supportive learning
environment. It has opened doors to opportunities that were previously inaccessible, enabling me to pursue my
educational goals on my own terms.

However, self-paced education is not without its challenges. It requires a high degree of self-discipline, motivation,
and time-management skills, which can be difficult to maintain, especially when dealing with health fluctuations.
Additionally, the lack of structured support and interaction with peers and instructors can lead to feelings of
isolation. Despite these challenges, the benefits of self-paced education far outweigh the drawbacks for learners like
me. It offers a level of flexibility and personalization that traditional education models simply cannot provide, making
it a vital option for those with multiple disabilities seeking to further their education. It is also seen as less
legitimate by employers and society at large, which means there are fewer student resources, discounts, financial aid
options, and less recognition of credentials earned through self-paced programs. This stigma can discourage learners
from pursuing self-paced education, despite its benefits.

## A Vision for Something Better

While self-paced education has been instrumental in my learning journey, there is still much work to be done to create a
truly inclusive and accessible educational landscape for multiply disabled learners. I envision a future where
educational institutions and programs are designed with flexibility and accessibility at their core, rather than as
afterthoughts. This includes offering a variety of learning formats, assessment methods, and support services tailored
to the diverse needs of learners. I also hope to see greater recognition and validation of self-paced education by
employers and society, which would help reduce stigma and increase access to resources for those pursuing
non-traditional learning paths. Additionally, I believe that building supportive communities of learners with similar
challenges can provide valuable peer support and encouragement. By advocating for systemic changes and promoting
awareness of the unique needs of multiply disabled learners, we can work towards creating an educational environment
that truly empowers all individuals to reach their full potential.

That same inclusivity must also extend to how financial support is structured. I envision scholarships and financial aid
models that do not require full-time or even half-time enrollment to be considered valid. Learning should not be
contingent on a student’s ability to maintain a specific pace, especially when that pace may be incompatible with their
health or disabilities. Financial support should recognize intent, effort, and persistence over time, rather than
enforcing rigid enrollment thresholds. When funding is flexible enough to accommodate reduced course loads, pauses, and
nonlinear progress, more learners are able to continue learning sustainably instead of being forced out by systems that
equate speed with seriousness.

## Closing Thoughts

Navigating education as a multiply disabled learner has been a complex and often challenging journey. Traditional
educational models have frequently fallen short in accommodating my unique needs, leading me to embrace self-paced
education as a more suitable alternative. Through self-paced learning, I have been able to tailor my educational
experience to better align with my abilities and circumstances, ultimately empowering me to take control of my learning
journey. While self-paced education is not without its challenges, it offers a level of flexibility and personalization
that traditional models cannot match. As we look to the future, it is essential to advocate for more inclusive and
accessible educational systems that recognize and support the diverse needs of all learners, particularly those with
multiple disabilities. By doing so, we can create a more equitable and empowering educational landscape for everyone.
This is not about doing more or moving faster. It is about making learning possible, sustainable, and humane.
