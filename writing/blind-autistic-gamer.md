Gaming has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. From puzzles as a child to text-based adventures in
school, games have always been a place of joy, challenge, and escape.

As a blind, autistic, chronically ill woman, though, finding games I can actually play — and enjoy — has become
increasingly difficult.

This post is for other disabled gamers, accessibility advocates, and developers who want to understand what
accessibility looks like in practice, not theory.

## Why Accessibility Is More Than Screen Readers

Because I'm totally blind, this article doesn't include screenshots. Instead, I focus on the features that actually
determine whether a game is playable for me.

Accessibility isn't just about adding text-to-speech. It's about:

- Cognitive load
- Sensory overwhelm
- Pace and pressure
- Whether the game respects limited energy

## Games I Play Now

My current gaming rotation is small but intentional.

### Word and Card Games

These are ideal on low-energy days. They're mentally engaging without being overwhelming, and most are fully accessible
with screen readers.

### Incremental Games

Incremental and idle games work well for me when they:

- Don't require fast reactions
- Allow pauses without penalty
- Avoid visual-only mechanics like maps or graphs

Games like _Evolve_ and _Trimps_ let me think, plan, and optimize without rushing.

### MUDs and Text-Based Games

I enjoy MUDs in theory, but in practice they can be exhausting:

- Heavy typing
- Spatial memory requirements
- Social expectations

I still return to them occasionally, but they aren't always sustainable.

## What Makes a Game Accessible _for Me_

Some features that consistently matter:

- **Untimed gameplay** or generous pacing
- **Minimal audio clutter** with the option to mute sound
- **Offline or idle progress**
- **Keyboard-only interaction**
- **Clear, labeled controls** that work with screen readers

A game can be technically accessible and still be unplayable if it overwhelms my nervous system.

## Why Finding New Games Is So Hard

Many games recommended for blind players rely on:

- Audio navigation
- Spatial awareness
- Fast reactions

Those are dealbreakers for me.

On the other side, many indie or incremental games use:

- Canvas
- WebGL
- Unity interfaces with poor labeling

I've lost count of how many times I've spent hours on a game only to discover I can't finish it.

## Final Thoughts

Gaming is still meaningful to me — but only when developers understand that accessibility isn't one-size-fits-all.

For multiply disabled players, accessibility means:

- flexibility
- respect for energy limits
- and the freedom to play slowly, thoughtfully, and on our own terms

I hope sharing my experience helps others feel less alone — and helps developers build games that more people can
actually enjoy.
